# e669

This is an experimental alternate client/browser intended to improve upon the limitations and design flaws of [e621.net](https://e621.net)'s standard browsing experience.

The primary purpose is to create a smoother and more flexible interface for browsing e621 and its content, minimizing the amount of extra clicks and actions needed to effectively navigate the website.

It is currently a work in progress and many planned features are not yet implemented.

There is a live version running at [e669.fun](https://e669.fun) that automatically updates from the master branch of this repo. If you would like to run your own instance, it should be drag and drop as everything is handled by pure html/css/js.

User [omnicons](https://github.com/omnicons) has gracefully provided a cors proxy to keep this project entirely js-based.
